        <pre>
With paint, you can make any colour out of red, yellow, and blue, apart from values of white and black.
With light, you can make any colour out of red, green, and blue.
If the intensity for all three values is maximum, you get white. If the intensity for all three values is zero, you get black.

        <summary>What is a Hex Code?</summary>
        <pre>
A hex code uses six symbols to tell the computer how much red, green, and blue you want in your colour:
The first two are for red, the next two are for green, and the last two are for blue.
A hex code looks like this: #RRGGBB

        <summary>Counting with Hex Codes</summary>
        <pre>
Instead of counting:
00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...
We count:
00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 0A, 0B, 0C, 0D, 0E, 0F
A means 10, B is 11, C is 12… …F is 15
After 0F (15), the next number is 10 (which means 16 in regular numbers)

        <summary>How Do You Read a Hex Value?</summary>
        <pre>
Each pair (like A5) is one colour's amount:
The first digit tells you how many groups of 16 you have (because hex counts in groups of 16).
The second digit tells you how many extra ones you have.
Example:
A5: A stands for 10, so it's (10 groups of 16) + 5
When you see bigger letters or numbers at the start of a pair, that's a much bigger number! If you see letters like "A" or "F" at the start, that's a lot of that colour.

        <summary>Guessing a colour from a Hex Code</summary>
        <pre>
If the red pair is high, the colour will be more red.
If the green pair is high, the colour will be more green.
If the blue pair is high, the colour will be more blue.
If all the pairs are low (like 00), the colour is dark (black).
If all the pairs are high (like FF), the colour is very bright (white).
If you see:
    00 = none of that colour
    FF = lots and lots of that colour
    In-between numbers or letters mean a medium amount
If only one colour has a big number, you see a strong version of that colour. If two are big, you see a mix (like red and blue make purple).

        <summary>Putting Hexadecimals in order and comparing</summary>
        <pre>
Mixing colours in hex codes is not the same as mixing colours in paint. Instead, we think of the combination of colours like light.
For example, mixing equal amounts of red and green together will result in the colour that is between the two on the colour spectrum, which is yellow.
Some notes on common color combinations are provided below:
  > Pure Red, Green, or Blue → turn up that color, leaving the other two at 0.
  > All at 255 (full saturation of all colors) → White
  > All at 0 (no color) → Black
  > Equal saturations of each → Gray
  > Red + Blue → Purple
  > Red + Green → Yellow
  > Green + Blue → Turquoise
  > Dark yellow → make yellow, then reduce both red and green
  > Orange → make yellow, but more red, less green

        <summary>Counting with Hex Codes</summary>
        <pre>
Just remember:
    Numbers and letters close to “F” or “E” are big.
    Ones with “0” at the start are small.
    Look at the first digit to see which is bigger; if they're the same, check the second digit!
So, if you remember:
    Hex pairs = how much of each colour light.
    Higher letters/numbers = more of that colour.
    Hex counts funny: 0, 1, 2, ... 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, 10, 11, ...
You’ll be ready to figure out which colour is which just by looking at the hex code!
